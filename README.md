# Hi, I'm Himanshu Shukla 👋

### Senior Product Engineer | AI Platforms | LLM Applications | Full-Stack | AWS

I build production-grade AI systems and full-stack products end-to-end — from architecture and backend systems to deployment and scaling.

My work focuses on designing intelligent platforms powered by Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and scalable cloud infrastructure.

## 🚀 What I Do

* Build AI platforms with multi-model orchestration, prompt versioning, and evaluation
* Develop LLM applications using OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source models
* Design and deploy Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines
* Fine-tune models and implement similarity search using embeddings
* Build full-stack applications from scratch
* Architect scalable backend systems and APIs
* Deploy and manage production systems on AWS and on-premise infrastructure
